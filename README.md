For Maruti

Code is super messy since I didn't get a chance to clean it up, but high level is:
- ws_app.py in python-app folder opens local UI
- z_muse_ws.py in MuseTalk folder runs server-side, handles processing and websocket connection

Lots of test files are scattered around the repo, but feel free to start with the above 2 files to get an idea of the implementation and go from there.
